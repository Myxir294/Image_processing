# Image_processing
Allows to make negatives, outlines and tresholiding operations on PPM and PGM images

By default, the program opens up a console user menu, allowing to choose beetween options displayed on the screen. In order to process the image, one has to open a file through menu (alternatively load it via passing stream to the program, not tested but technically should work), choose an operation and than display the image, with the posiblity of saving it in the new file. The program allows to do different operations on the same picture or to pick only a single colour to be processed (by default, in PPM files all are chosen). Choosing gray will convert the image to PGM (the user still has to manually add a .PGM extension to the new filename, otherwise it may not be recognized correclty by the system).
